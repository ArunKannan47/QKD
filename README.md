Quantum Key Distribution
Network applications have become ubiquitous in todayâ€™s world,
which are accessed through both wired and wireless networks. Therefore safeguarding the
network infrastructure is a necessity and extra precaution has to be taken to ensure that the
data is protected from any security breaches, so that privacy is ensured. With the advent of
quantum computers more application security issues arise in the symmetric and asymmetric
cryptographic methods which are currently being used. These encryptions use mathematical
calculations for key generation which can be cracked by quantum computers within minutes
by means of reverse calculation. So an alternate and new method of Lightweight
authentication technique for Quantum Key Distribution is used which is based on the two
laws of quantum mechanics which are Heisenberg uncertainity principle and quantum
entanglement which state that performing a measurement on one object affects the other. If
an entangled pair of objects is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either object
alters the overall system, revealing the presence of the third party and therefore interception
is detected by the system preventing security breaches. This key generated using the
quantum bits called qubits is then used as the secret key for the traditional cryptographic
procedures thus providing a security that is unbreakable and unhackable, resulting in better
security to the networks. The analysis of results for the key generation with interception and
without interception by a eavesdropper is simulated for detection of the eavesdropper the
chance of being spied upon unknowingly is 0.02% for a sample size of 20 in 10,000
iterations, which is infinitesimal and ensures the security of the network infrastructure. The
time and space complexity of the Quantum Key generation are calculated and analysed. The
time to generate a 1024 bits RSA key-pair is 4.76 seconds while that of Lightweight
authentication for Quantum Key Distribution takes only 3.49 seconds and also the
percentage increase of memory usage is only 38.6455% considering the large marginal
difference in message length. Also the Quantum Bit Error rate (QBER) and the reconciliation
efficiency of Cascade protocol is established for the generated quantum key
